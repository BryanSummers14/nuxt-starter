# static-template

> Nuxt.js project - The goal is to add a cli command that will use a config.json file to generate pages, layouts, components, store, and dependencies for smaller static sites

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
